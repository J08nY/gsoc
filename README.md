This repo holds scripts related to managing Google Summer of Code for the Python Software Foundation

The issues tracker is used to help us keep track of ideas we have for
improving the programme.  Please feel free to make suggestions there,
although do remember that we have only limited volunteer time and
availability, so not every great idea is likely to get implemented.

Help with implementing these ideas is very much appreciated!
